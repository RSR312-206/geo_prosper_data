Geo-Prosper-Data
----------------

A repository which I used as sandbox for working with the data from the census.gov api and the BLS.gov api. 

Each API had a specific Alpha-numeric code which represented ceach city, job title, and city metric.
Scripts were written to extract the necessary datapoints from the text files to then seed the Geo-Propser database
with the appropriate codes for the API calls.
